## Overview
This guide provides instructions on how to upgrade a stock TPCast device to OpenTPCast, which replaces the stock TPCast Connection Assistant software with a VirtualHere based solution running on Raspbian Stretch, and enables use of the on-board microphone and auxiliary USB port in the HTC Vive, and on-board microphone in the Oculus Rift.

## Disclaimer
**This upgrade is performed at your own risk! OpenTPCast and its contributers will not be held responsible for any physical damage, data loss or voided manufacturer warranties incurred due to modification or tampering of your TPCast hardware or software.**

This upgrade requires opening up your TPCast power box to remove and flash the internal MicroSD card with an OpenTPCast image.  We do not recommend performing this upgrade without [backing up the MicroSD card of your TPCast power box](SDCARD.md) to ensure that your TPCast device can be [restored](SDCARD.md#restoring-an-image-to-a-microsd-card) back to factory settings in the event of software compatibility issues during or after the upgrade.

To use VirtualHere USB Server, a TPCast-optimized licence key must be [purchased](https://www.virtualhere.com/tpcast_purchase) ($25 USD) after the upgrade.

## Preparation
### Hardware
- Ensure that your TPCast is functioning correctly with the stock router and software before attempting the upgrade.
- A MicroSD card reader is required to backup and flash images to your MicroSD card on your computer.
- A small phillips/crossheaded screwdriver is required to open the TPCast power box.
- Your device may come included with a Class 4 MicroSD card.  A Class 10 MicroSD card (4GB or higher in capacity) is recommended to speed up TPCast boot times.

### Software
- Ensure that any TPCast software is not running on your local machine during or after the upgrade.
- Ensure that you have at least 8GB of free space on your local machine during the upgrade to back up the TPCast MicroSD card.
- Download and extract (using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)) the latest [OpenTPCast](https://github.com/OpenTPCast/Docs/releases) image.
- Download and install [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) on your local machine, which will be used to back up and restore images to and from a MicroSD card.
- Download & install [VirtualHere USB Client](https://virtualhere.com/usb_client_software) on your local machine, which will be used to forward USB devices associated with your VR device over your local network.  Note that a TPCast-optimized licence key must be [purchased](https://www.virtualhere.com/tpcast_purchase) to use with VirtualHere USB Server after the upgrade.
  - If you are prompted at any point to install Bonjour, you must install it to ensure that the TPCast can be discovered by VirtualHere USB Client correctly.

### Miscellaneous
- Follow the guide as it is laid out without skipping steps otherwise you may run into issues later.

## Installation
### Accessing The TPCast Power Box MicroSD Card

1. Remove the battery from the TPCast power box.

## Updating OpenTPCast
To update your TPCast to a new OpenTPCast release in future, simply repeat the steps in this upgrade guide, flashing the SD card with the [latest OpenTPCast image](https://github.com/OpenTPCast/Docs/releases).  Note that you will have to reapply your previously purchased VirtualHere USB Server licence after reflashing the SD card with a new OpenTPCast image.

## Updating VirtualHere USB Server
![Updating VirtualHere USB Server using OpenTPCast Control Panel](../img/updating-virtualhere-usb-server.jpg)
To update VirtualHere USB Server, navigate to http://tpcast.local (or `http://<tpcast-ip-address>`) using a web browser, select `VirtualHere USB Server` then click `Install Latest Version`.

## Connecting To The TPCast Over SSH
To connect to the TPCast power box to troubleshoot issues or perform further modifications, use the following details:
* Hostname: tpcast.local
* Port: 22
* Username: pi
* Password: 1qaz2wsx3edc4rfv

## Troubleshooting
### VirtualHere Issues
**VirtualHere USB Client is not detecting the TPCast power box.**
* Check the TPCast router's DHCP list while the TPCast power box is turned on to make sure that it is connected to the network, and ping the TPCast power box from your computer to make sure it can be reached.
  * The TPCast router control panel can be accessed from http://192.168.144.1 (CE) or http://192.168.1.1 (PRE) using a web browser and the following credentials:
    - Username: tproot (if prompted)
    - Password: 8427531 (CE) or 12345678 (PRE)
  * Navigate to `DHCP Server` > `DHCP Clients List` and look for a client with the host name `TPCAST`, taking note of the associated IP address.
* Ensure that you have Bonjour installed and your firewall is not blocking Bonjour or VirtualHere USB Client so that VirtualHere can detect the TPCast power box, otherwise you will have to manually specify the IP address of the TPCast power box in VirtualHere USB Client by right clicking `USB Hubs` > `Specify Hubs...` > `Add` > `192.168.XXX.XXX:7575` > `OK`.

### Tracking Issues
If you experience tracking issues or devices are being dropped in SteamVR / Oculus Home after upgrading, try [switching Wi-Fi channels](ROUTER.md#switching-to-another-wi-fi-channel) or [switching Wi-Fi network mode](ROUTER.md#switching-to-another-wi-fi-network-mode) in your TPCast router.

### SteamVR Issues
**SteamVR does not detect devices, displays errors or the HMD screen appears black.**
* Reboot your computer and power cycle all devices including the TPCast power box, HDMI transmitter, router and HTC Vive break-out box (if applicable).

### Audio Issues
**Audio signal frequently drops out.**
* Ensure that HDMI audio is selected as the default audio device in SteamVR.  If drop-outs persist, [switch Wi-Fi channels](ROUTER.md#switching-to-another-wi-fi-channel) in your TPCast router.

**Audio signal sounds distorted or crackles.**
* Adjust the sample rate of the audio device in Windows sound settings by going to `Control Panel` > `Sound` > Right click `HTC-VIVE` or `Rift Audio` > `Properties` > `Advanced` > Change `Default Format` to `44100Hz` or `48000Hz` depending on which option is already selected.
